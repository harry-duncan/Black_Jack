#Project ZERO.2.1
##Hack Jack ~ Harry Style
With its succes I'll be trying to run game nights at GA as a result.

#### Just a heads up, you're all going to lose fucking badly.

Fucking yeah! 

(total black jack pun in the naming of this .md)


This is my HACK JACK game that I built using JavaScript / jQuery / HTML & CSS
You can find the game online [here](http://harry-duncan.github.io/Black_Jack/ "HACK JACK") hosted thanks to Github Pages

## Approach taken

Originally I looked at this as an entire problem and it was too overwhelming. After fucking around for ages last night to try and get a deck of cards working i re-assessed and took a new approach.

I broke this down into fuckloads of tiny problems and solved them one at a time! 

I started this last night after being sick and giving up on trying to get cool shit to happen on my portfolio site, which ill be woring on over the weekend.

So this isnt too stylish at the moment as i only spent 10hrs on this in total and pushed to get it working in time! 

## Shoutout
To jack for helping me this morning with some complex shit i still dont fully get and github for hosting my page, also id like to thank colin for constantly having my back with jQuery and ben for constantly being supportive!
